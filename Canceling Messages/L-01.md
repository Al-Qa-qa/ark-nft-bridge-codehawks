## Title
Canceling messages is not checking if the Bridge is enabled or not.

## Vulnerability Details
`L1Bridge` have a pausing functionality, where if the Bridge is passed `enable` variable is set to `false`.

[Bridge.sol#L358-L362](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L358-L362)
```solidity
    function enableBridge(
        bool enable
    ) external onlyOwner {
        _enabled = enable;
    }
```

If the Bridge is not enabled (paused), this means we can't use it. So we are preventing Depositing and Withdrawing from that Bridge, but the problem is that canceling Messages is not checking this.

[Bridge.sol#L243-L246](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L243-L246)
```solidity
    function cancelRequest(
        uint256[] memory payload,
        uint256 nonce
    ) external {
        // @audit No checking if the Bridge is enabled or not
❌️      IStarknetMessaging(_starknetCoreAddress).cancelL1ToL2Message( ... );
        Request memory req = Protocol.requestDeserialize(payload, 0);
        _cancelRequest(req);
        emit CancelRequestCompleted(req.hash, block.timestamp);
    }
```

When we cancel a message from Bridge, we withdraw the Tokens from Bridge, and if the Bridge is `paused` this thing should not occur, as the Bridge interactions should be paused, and we should not be able to deposit or withdraw tokens from it.

## Impact
The ability to interact with the Bridge and cancel messages even if the Bridge is disabled, in addition to the ability to withdraw the tokens in the canceled message.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Check that the Bridge is enabled when canceling the message.
