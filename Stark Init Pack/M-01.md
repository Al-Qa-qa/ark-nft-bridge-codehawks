## Title
No Storage Gap for Stark L2 Bridge

## Vulnerability Details

In upgradable contracts, there should be a storage location for variables to get added freely without causing any storage collision. In `Bridge.sol` we can see that the contract inherits from a lot of contracts each of them has its own variables.

[bridge.cairo#L62-L87](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L62-L87)
```cairo
    struct Storage {
        ...
        // Bridge enabled flag
        enabled: bool,
        
        #[substorage(v0)]
❌️      ownable: OwnableComponent::Storage,
    }
```

We are putting the ownable sub-storage after the main storage so if the Bridge storage took slot(0, 1, ..., 10). Ownable will take slots(11, 12). Any upgrade by adding a variable to the Bridge will result in Storage Collision. 

The `Bridge.cairo` is intended to be an upgradable contract, where we can easily change its ClassHash from `BridgeUpgradeImpl::upgrade`.

[bridge.cairo#L184-L198](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L184-L198)
```cairo
    impl BridgeUpgradeImpl of IUpgradeable<ContractState> {
        fn upgrade(ref self: ContractState, class_hash: ClassHash) {
            ensure_is_admin(@self);

❌️          match starknet::replace_class_syscall(class_hash) { ... };
        }
    }
```

So we will not be able to upgrade the contract and add new variables as Storaage Collision will occur.

The case is the same in `erc721_bridgeable`, where we are importing the sub storage in the beginning, and we do not have any gap.

[erc721_bridgeable.cairo#L37-L47](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/token/erc721_bridgeable.cairo#L37-L47)
```cairo
    struct Storage {
        bridge: ContractAddress,
        /// token_uris is required if we want uris not derivated from base_uri
        token_uris: LegacyMap<u256, ByteArray>,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        erc721: ERC721Component::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        src5: SRC5Component::Storage,
        #[substorage(v0)]
        ownable: OwnableComponent::Storage,
    }
```

## Impact
Inability to upgrade these contracts if a new variable will be added.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
1. Move the Sub Storage from the Bottom to the Top, and make the main contract variables in the last
2. Add a Gap to preserve Storage Slots for Variables that can be added in the future.

The same thing should be made for `erc721_bridgeable`.
