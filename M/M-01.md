## Title
No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

## Vulnerability Details

In upgradable contracts, there should be a storage location for variables to get added freely without causing any storage collision. In `Bridge.sol` we can see that the contract inherits from a lot of contracts each of them has its own variables.

[Bridge.sol#L30](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L30)
```solidity
contract Starklane is IStarklaneEvent, UUPSOwnableProxied, StarklaneState, StarklaneEscrow, StarklaneMessaging, CollectionManager {

    // Mapping (collectionAddress => bool)
    mapping(address => bool) _whiteList;
    address[] _collections;
    bool _enabled;
    bool _whiteListEnabled;
    ...
}
```

If we checked `StarklaneState` for example we will find that it has its own variables.

[State.sol#L13-L22](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/State.sol#L13-L22)
```solidity
contract StarklaneState is Ownable {

    // StarknetCore.
    IStarknetMessaging _starknetCoreAddress;

    // Starklane L2 address for messaging.
    snaddress _starklaneL2Address;

    // Bridge L2 selector to deposit token from L1.
    felt252 _starklaneL2Selector;
    ...
}
```

Since the idea of upgrading the contract is either adding features or fixing issues, there can be new variables added. So any addition of new variables in one of the child contracts that `Bridge` inherits from them, will result in storage collision and corruption of all the contract states.

## Impact
Inability to add new features / fix issues to the contract, which will require adding variables to contracts That `Bridge` inherit from it.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Adding Storage Gap to All Contracts that the `Bridge` contract Directly inherits from them, this includes `UUPSOwnableProxied`, `StarklaneState`, `StarklaneEscrow`, `StarklaneMessaging`, and `CollectionManager`.

```solidity
    uint256[50] private __gap;
```
