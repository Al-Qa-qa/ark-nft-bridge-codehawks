## Title
Existed collections are not whitelisted when Bridging

## Vulnerability Details
When Bridging NFTs between `L1<->L2`, we are whitelisting the NFT collection in the destination chain if it is not whitelisted, and since we are checking that depositing NFTs from the source chain should be from a whitelisted NFT, it is important to integrability between L1 and L2.

The problem is that we are only whitelisting the collection on the destination chain if it doesn't have an attachment to it on L1, whereas after deploying it we are whitelisting it. But if the collection already existed we are not whitelisting it if needed.

[Bridge.sol#L183-L196](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L183-L196)
```solidity
        if (collectionL1 == address(0x0)) {
            if (ctype == CollectionType.ERC721) {
                collectionL1 = _deployERC721Bridgeable( ... );
                // update whitelist if needed
❌️              _whiteListCollection(collectionL1, true);
            } else {
                revert NotSupportedYetError();
            }
        }
```

As we can see, whitelisting occurs only if the NFT collection does not exist on `L1`, so whitelisting the collection will not occur if the collection already exists.

We will discuss the scenario where this can occur and introduce problems in the `Proof of Concept` section.

## Proof of Concept

- whitelisting is disabled, and any NFT can be Bridged.
- NFTs are Bridged from L1, To L2.
- NFT collections on L1 are not whitelisted collections now (whitelisting is disabled).
- On L2 we are deploying addresses that maps to Collections on L1 and whitelist them. 
- the protocol enables whiteListing.
- NFTs collections that were created on L2 are now whitelisted and can be Bridged to L1, but still, these Collection L1 addresses are not whitelisted.
- We can Bridge from L2 to L1 easily as these collections are whitelisted.
- We can withdraw the NFT from L1 easily (there is no check for whitelisting when withdrawing).
- since `L1<->L2` mapping is already set. NFTs Collections are still `not-whitelisted` on L1.
- The process will end up with the ability to Bridge NFTs from `L2 to L1` as they are whitelisted on L2, but the inability to Bridge them from `L1 to L2` as they are not whitelisted on `L1`.

Manual Review

## Recommendations
Whitelist the collection if it is newly deployed or if it already exists and is not whitelisted.

## Existence of the issue on the Starknet Side
This issue explains the flow from Ethereum to Starknet. the problem also existed in L2 side, where we are only whitelisting if there is no address for that collection on `L2`. If the `collection_l2 == 0`, we are deploying the collection on L2 and whitelist it. But if it is already existed we are just returning the address without whitelisting it if existed, same as that in L1.

[bridge.cairo#L440-L442](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L440-L442)
```cairo
    fn ensure_erc721_deployment(ref self: ContractState, req: @Request) -> ContractAddress {
        ...
        let collection_l2 = verify_collection_address( ... );

        if !collection_l2.is_zero() {
❌️          return collection_l2;
        }
        ...
        // update whitelist if needed
        let (already_white_listed, _) = self.white_listed_list.read(l2_addr_from_deploy);
        if already_white_listed != true {
            _white_list_collection(ref self, l2_addr_from_deploy, true);
            ...
        }
        l2_addr_from_deploy
    }
```

So if we changed the order, the Collections can be whitelisted on `L1`, but not on `L2` (if the Proof of Concept was in the reverse order), Bridging these NFTs collections from L1 to L2 will be allowed, but we will not be able to Bridge them from `L2` to `L1`, as they are not whitelisted on `L2`.

**Recommendations**: the same as that in `L1`, we need to whitelist collections if they already exist.
