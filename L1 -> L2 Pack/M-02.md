## Title
Escrowed NFTs are not burned when withdrawing them from `L2Bridge`.

## Vulnerability Details

In `L1Bridge` when we are withdrawing NFTs, and these NFTs are held by the Bridge, we transfer them from the Bridge to the receiver, then we burn that NFT by setting escrow address to `zero`.

[Escrow.sol#L76-L86](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Escrow.sol#L76-L86)
```solidity
    function _withdrawFromEscrow( ... ) ... {
        ...

        address from = address(this);

        if (collectionType == CollectionType.ERC721) {
1:          IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(from, to, id);
        } else {
            // TODO:
            // Check here if the token supply is currently 0.
            IERC1155(collection).safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, 1, "");
        }

2:      _escrow[collection][id] = address(0x0);

        return true;
    }
```

But in `L2Bridge` escrowed NFT token is not burned when transferring, we are just transferring the NFT without resetting the escrow mapping to `address_zero`.

[bridge.cairo#L157-L162](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L157-L162)
```cairo
            let is_escrowed = !self.escrow.read((collection_l2, token_id)).is_zero();

            if is_escrowed {
❌️              IERC721Dispatcher { contract_address: collection_l2 }
                .transfer_from(from, to, token_id);
                // @audit NFT is not reset to zero?!!
            } else { ... }
```

So this will result in an NFT being escrowed by the `L2Bridge` (which is like being owned by him), But it is actually owned by another owner, which is the `ownerL2` that received the tokens when Bridging tokens from `L1` to `L2`.

## Proof of Concept
- UserA Bridged an NFT token from `L2` to `L1` via `L2Bridge::deposit_tokens()`.
- This NFT token is now escrowed by the `L2Bridge` and it holds it.
- UserA received the NFT on `L1` by his `L1Address`.
- Time passed, and this NFT is traded between addresses.
- This NFT is now getting Bridged from `L1` to `L2` via `L1Bridge::depositTokens()`
- This NFT token is now escrowed by the `L1Bridge` and it holds it.
- This token is getting withdrawn from `L2Bridge`.
- Token was transferred to the `ownerL2` but did not burn on `L2Bridge` (it is still escrowed).
- NFT token is escrowed by `L2Bridge`, but it doesn't hold it.
- NFT tokens is escrowed in both `L1Bridge` and `L2Bridge`.

## Impacts
- Incorrect State modification, where the NFT tokens will still be escrowed by `L2Bridge` but it doesn't hold them.
- The NFTs will be escrowed in both `L1Bridge` and `L2Bridge` which breaks NFTs bridging invariant, where the NFT will exist in both Bridged in the time it should only be on only one Bridge (should be escrowed one chain).

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Burn the NFT by setting its escrow to `address_zero` in `L2Bridge`.
