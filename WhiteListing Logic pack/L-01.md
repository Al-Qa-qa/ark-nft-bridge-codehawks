## Title
Incorrect Check when removing an NFT collection from whitelisting in `L2Bridge`

## Vulnerability Details
When we are adding new elements into whitelists in `L2Bridge` we are using a Linked list for that mission. To know the ending of the linked list we do two checks. The next element should be either zero or not activated to represent that this is the ending of the linked list.

[bridge.cairo#L502-L513](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L502-L513)
```cairo
        // find last element
        loop {
            let (_, next) = self.white_listed_list.read(prev);
1:          if next.is_zero() {
                break;
            }
            let (active, _) = self.white_listed_list.read(next);
2:          if !active {
                break;
            }
            prev = next;
        };
```
As we can see we check that the next is not zero, or it is not active to represent the ending of the linked list.

The problem is that this check is not implemented corectly in case of removing where instead of checking the activation of the next element we are checking the activation of the current element, which is not a correct check to determine the ending of the linked list.

[bridge.cairo#L523-L538](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L523-L538)
```cairo
        // removed element from linked list
        loop {
            let (active, next) = self.white_listed_list.read(prev);
            if next.is_zero() {
                // end of list
                break;
            }
❌️          if !active {
                break;
            }
            if next == collection { ... }
        };
```

As we can see we are checking the activation of the `prev` node, not the next node, which is not the correct check that is implemented when adding new elements.

This is an incorrect logic in the code, where reaching to the end of the array should have the same logic when adding or removing.

## Recommendations
Check for the activation of the `next` node instead of the `prev` when removing.
