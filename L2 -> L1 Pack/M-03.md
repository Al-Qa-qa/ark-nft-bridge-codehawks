## Title
Possibility of reverting when withdrawing Tokens from L1, if the receiver is an AA wallet

## Vulnerability Details

When Bridging tokens from `L2->L1`, we provide the receiver address in L1, and after we made the tx on L2, gets proved by Starknet Protocol, the user can call `L1Bridge::withdrawTokens()` to receive his tokens in L1.

We extract the tokens Bridged from `L2` to `L1`, and if that token was escrowed in `L1Bridge` we send it to the user from the `L1Bridge` to him, otherwise we mint it.

[Bridge.sol#L201](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L201)
```solidity
    function withdrawTokens( ... ) ... {
        ...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < req.tokenIds.length; i++) {
            ...
❌️          bool wasEscrowed = _withdrawFromEscrow(ctype, collectionL1, req.ownerL1, id);
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
```

When we transfer ERC721 token to the user we are using `safeTransferFrom` function, which checks if the receiver is a contract it calls `onERC721Receiver()` function.

[Escrow.sol#L79](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Escrow.sol#L79)
```solidity
    function _withdrawFromEscrow(... ) ... {
        ...

        if (collectionType == CollectionType.ERC721) {
❌️          IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(from, to, id);
        } else { ... }
        ...
    }
```

The problem is that if the receiver is an Account Abstraction wallet, this function `onERC721Receiver()` is not a must to be presented. The implementation of AA Wallets didn't implement this interface nor it is implemented in the `ERC4337`. so if the receiver is an AA wallet the transaction will revert as it will not find that function and will revert.

This doesn't mean that the NFT will be lost. since AA wallets contains `execute` function that can call arbitraty calls, they can handle NFTs, so implementing that interface `onERC721Receiver()` is not a must.

## Proof of Concept
- UserA wants to Bridge NFTs from `L2` to `L1`.
- UserA wants to send his NFTs to his AA wallet on `L1`.
- UserA initiated the tx and called `L2Bridge::deposit_tokens()`.
- When UserA wanted to call the `L1Bridge::withdrawTokens()` to withdraw his tokens.
- tx reverted as the UserA `AA` wallet do not implement `onERC721Receive()`.
- NFTs will be locked in the Bridge, and lost forever.

## Impact
if the receiver on `L1` was an AA wallet NFTs may end up locked in the Bridge forever without having the apility to withdraw them.

## Recommendations
Use `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer` when transferring NFTs.
