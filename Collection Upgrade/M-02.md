## Title
There is no way to change NFTs collections Ownership on `L1` that is mapped to Original Collections on `L2`

## Vulnerability Details
When we are bridging Tokens `L1<->L2` if the NFT collection in the source chain has no address on the destination chain, we are deploying new ERC721 NFT collection addresses and attaching them.

When deploying the NFT collection, we are deploying it with an `owner`, which is `L1Bridge`.

[Deployer.sol#L32-L35](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/token/Deployer.sol#L32-L35)
```solidity
    function deployERC721Bridgeable( ... ) ... {
        address impl = address(new ERC721Bridgeable());
        
❌️      bytes memory dataInit = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            ERC721Bridgeable.initialize.selector,
            abi.encode(name, symbol)
        );

        return address(new ERC1967Proxy(impl, dataInit));
    }

    ...

    function initialize( ... ) ... {
        ...
❌️      _transferOwnership(_msgSender());
    }
```

Ownership is transferred to the `msg.sender` of `initialize`, which is `L1Bridge` who deployed the proxy contract with that init data.

The problem is there is no way to transfer the ownership of a given `ERC721` collection, which is not the case in `L2`, where the ownership can be transferred to another owner.

[bridge.cairo#L375-L380](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L375-L380)
```cairo
        // transfer owner of the given collection to the given address
        fn collection_transfer_ownership(ref self: ContractState, collection: ContractAddress, new_owner: ContractAddress) {
            ensure_is_admin(@self);
            IOwnableDispatcher { contract_address: collection }
                .transfer_ownership(new_owner);
        }
```

This will result inability to transfer the ownership of a given collection on `L2` that has a deployed address on `L1` to another owner (like the original creators of that NFTs), which is not the way the `L2Bridge` work.

## Proof of Concept
- Bridge is active
- Tokens are Bridge `L1<->L2`
- There are new collections created on `L1` and attached to original collections on `L2`
- There are new collections created on `L2` and attached to original collections on `L1`
- The admin decided to transfer ownership of a given collection created on `L1`
- The admin will be able to transfer the ownership of that collection.

## Impact
Inability to change ownership of Created NFT collections on `L1`

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a function to change the ownership of an NFT collection on `L1Bridge`, the same as that in `L2Bridge`.
