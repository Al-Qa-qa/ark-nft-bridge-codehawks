## Title
There is no way to upgrade NFTs collections on `L1` that is mapped to Original Collections on `L2`

## Vulnerability Details
When we are bridging Tokens `L1<->L2` if the NFT collection in the source chain has no address on the destination chain, we are deploying new ERC721 NFT collection addresses and attaching them.

When deploying we are making the Collection upgradable, where we can change the implementation of that NFT collection if needed.

[Deployer.sol#L23-L38](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/token/Deployer.sol#L23-L38)
```solidity
    function deployERC721Bridgeable(... ) ... {
❌️      address impl = address(new ERC721Bridgeable());
        
        bytes memory dataInit = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            ERC721Bridgeable.initialize.selector,
            abi.encode(name, symbol)
        );

❌️      return address(new ERC1967Proxy(impl, dataInit));
    }
```

Since ERC1967 makes the Proxy admin is the sender, so the Bridge is the only address that can upgrade the Collection implementation.

The issue is that no method exists in our `L1Bridge` contract to upgrade the NFT collection implementation in `L1`. However, if we checked the `L2Bridge` we will find that upgrading an NFT collection is a supported thing and intended.

[bridge.cairo#L369-L373](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L369-L373)
```cairo
        fn collection_upgrade(ref self: ContractState, collection: ContractAddress, class_hash: ClassHash) {
            ensure_is_admin(@self);
            IUpgradeableDispatcher { contract_address: collection }
                .upgrade(class_hash);
        }
```

As we can see in `L2Bridge` there is a function `collection_upgrade` which takes the NFT collection address and calls `upgrade`, which will allow upgrading the created NFT collection implementation if needed.

This will result in the inability to upgrade NFT collections that was deployed on `L1` if needed.

## Proof of Concept
- Bridge is active
- Tokens are Bridge `L1<->L2`
- There are new collections created on `L1` and attacked to original collections on `L2`
- There are new collections created on `L2` and attacked to original collections on `L1`
- The admin decided to upgrade some collections created on `L1` and `L2`
- The admin will be able to upgrade `L2` collections but will not be able to upgrade `L1` collections

## Impact
Inability to upgrade Created NFT collections on `L1`

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a function to upgrade the NFT collection on `L1Bridge`, the same as that in `L2Bridge`.
