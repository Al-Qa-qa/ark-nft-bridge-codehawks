## Title
`L2Bridge` Deployes Collections before checking there type

## Vulnerability Details
When Bridging tokens `L1->L2`, we are deploying a new address for that Bridged token NFT collection on `L1` on `L2` if it has no attacked address on `L2`.

The problem is that in `L2Bridge::withdraw_auto_from_l1()` we are always deploying an `ERC721` address without checking the `ctype` first.

[bridge.cairo#L141-L143](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L141-L143)
```cairo
    #[l1_handler]
    fn withdraw_auto_from_l1( ... ) {
        ...

1:      let collection_l2 = ensure_erc721_deployment(ref self, @req);

2:      let _ctype = collection_type_from_header(req.header);
    }
```

As we can see we deploy the collection address in the first as an `ERC721`, without checking this type either `ERC721` or `ERC1155`.

Although this should not result in any problems unless data altered when Bridged in the current implementation, this is no the way the `L1Bridge` work when withdrawing. where we are checking for the ctype before we deploy new collections.

[Bridge.sol#L181-L196](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L181-L196)
```solidity
1:      CollectionType ctype = Protocol.collectionTypeFromHeader(header);

        if (collectionL1 == address(0x0)) {
2:          if (ctype == CollectionType.ERC721) {
                collectionL1 = _deployERC721Bridgeable( ... );
                // update whitelist if needed
                _whiteListCollection(collectionL1, true);
            } else {
                revert NotSupportedYetError();
            }
        }
```
As we can see in `L1` Bridge, we are checking for the type, and if it is `ERC721` we are deploying an ERC721 collection, and if not we are reverting the tx. which is not the case in `L2` Bridge withdrawing which does not preventing Bridging `ERC1155` tokens to be Bridged.

Manual Review

## Recommendations
Check that the ctype is `ERC721` before deploying, and if not revert the tx
