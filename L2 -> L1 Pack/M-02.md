## Title
Users can create NFT collections on L1 not related to NFT collections on L2

## Vulnerability Details
When Bridging NFTs from L1 -> L2, we are doing some checks. This includes ensuring a supported `ERC721` interface. and `tokens` to be bridged be greater than `0`.

But When bridging from L2 -> L1, these two checks do not exist. we neither detect the interface nor check that the `tokenIds` is greater than zero.

1. When we are getting `erc721_metadata` without checking interface support, which is named `
introspection` or `ERC165` in EVM. And we are doing the function with `Option` returned value. So if there is an error occur when calling `erc721.name()` or `erc721.symbol()`, the function will simply return `Option::None` and will not revert the tx execution.

[bridge.cairo#L266-L270](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L266-L270)
```cairo
fn erc721_metadata(
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    token_ids: Option<Span<u256>>
) -> Option<ERC721Metadata> {

...

    let erc721_metadata = erc721_metadata(collection_l2, Option::Some(token_ids));
    let (name, symbol, base_uri, uris) = match erc721_metadata {
        Option::Some(data) => (data.name, data.symbol, data.base_uri, data.uris),
❌️      Option::None => ("", "", "", array![].span())
    };
```

2. When we send tokens to the `L2Bridge` via `escrow_deposit_tokens`, we are not checking that tokens to be bridged are greater than zero, which is not the case in `L1Bridge` where there is a check to ensure tokens are greater than `zero`.

> L2Bridge:
[bridge.cairo#L402-L407](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L402-L407)
```cairo
    // @audit No check for `0` amount tokens
    fn escrow_deposit_tokens( ... ) {
        let to = starknet::get_contract_address();
        let erc721 = IERC721Dispatcher { contract_address };

        let mut i = 0_usize;
        loop { ... };
    }
```

> L1Bridge:
[Escrow.sol#L33](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Escrow.sol#L33)
```solidity
    function _depositIntoEscrow( ... ) internal {
❌️      assert(ids.length > 0);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            uint256 id = ids[i];
    }
```

So after collecting these two issues together we will be able to pass any address as `collection_l2`, and the tx will get processed successfully.

This will result in deploying an ERC721 collection on l1 and tie it with that arbitrary address passed as `collection_l2` by the called of `L2Bridge::deposit_tokens()`, which breaks the invariant of Linking NFTs collection on L1 and L2 and will link L1 NFT collection with arbitrary address or even an EOA on L2.

## Impact
Linking non NFT collection address on L2 to an NFT collection address on L1

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
Check that the tokens to be bridges is greater than zero, this will ensure that this is an NFT collection as we are calling `erc721.transfer_from` and if did not support this interface it will revert the tx.
