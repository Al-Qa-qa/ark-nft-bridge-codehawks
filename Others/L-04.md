## Title
`erc721_bridgable::mint_range` is not checking if the `end` is greater than `start`

## Vulnerability Details
There is a method called `mint_range` in the custom implementation of `ERC721` on `L2` where it can be used by the owner to mint owner to mint more than one NFT at one time.

[erc721_bridgeable.cairo#L141-L150](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/token/erc721_bridgeable.cairo#L141-L150)
```cairo
        fn mint_range(ref self: ContractState, to: ContractAddress, start: u256, end: u256) {
            // @audit no check that end is greater than start
            let mut token_id = start;
            loop {
                    if token_id == end {
                        break ();
                    }
                self.mint(to, token_id);
                token_id += 1_u256;
            }
        }
```

As we can see there is no check that `end` is greater than `start` which is not a normal thing to leave without checking it when doing sequential operations like minting tokens in order.

If `end` equals s`start` we will end up not minting anything, as we are not including the end in that implementation of the function. and if the `end` is smaller than `start` will go in an infinite loop which will make our tx go `OOG`.

## Recommendations
Check that the `end` is greater than `start`
