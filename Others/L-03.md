## Title
Hardcoding string offset slot is not a good approach

## Vulnerability Details

In our library `Cairo.sol`, we are getting the length of the string by reading the offset `0x20` directly without knowing if this is the correct memory slot that contains the length or not.

[Cairo.sol#L265](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/sn/Cairo.sol#L265)
```solidity
    function cairoStringPack(string memory str) ... {
        ...
❌️      uint256 offset = 0x20; // length is first u256
        ...
    }
```

Encoding string variables always puts the length offset in the first slot `0x00` and in this slot (`0x00`) the length slot value is written, which always comes directly after it in most and normal encodings (i.e `0x20`).

Although this is the normal encoding string method, the offset contains the length slot which can come after it directly, or after escaping on the slot, 2 slots, ... So we cannot guarantee that the string encoding is always putting the length value at slot `0x20`.

This will result in a wrong encoding of the string. which will make incorrect results when encoding string values.

## Recommendations

Retrieve the length slot from the offset first, and then use it to read the string value and pack it, instead of directly reading it from slot `0x20`.
