## Title
NFT Collection `l1<->l2` setting is always forced in `L2Bridge`.

## Vulnerability Details
The Bridge takes an NFT from the source chain, and `transfer/mint` it to the receiver on the destination chain. If The collection we bridged has no address on the destination chain we deploy a new one.

There is an Admin function that is used to set `l1<->l2` NFT collection addresses, where it can be used by the admin to set the NFT collection addresses on `L1` and `L2` himself.

[CollectionManager.sol#L151-L165](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/token/CollectionManager.sol#L151-L165)
```solidity
    function _setL1L2AddressMapping(
        address collectionL1,
        snaddress collectionL2,
        bool force
    ) internal {
        if (((snaddress.unwrap(_l1ToL2Addresses[collectionL1]) == 0) && (_l2ToL1Addresses[collectionL2] == address(0)))
            || (force == true)) {
            _l1ToL2Addresses[collectionL1] = collectionL2;
            _l2ToL1Addresses[collectionL2] = collectionL1;
        } else {
            revert CollectionMappingAlreadySet();
        }
    }
```

As we can see in the implementation on `L1Bridge` if the collections are already set we are not resetting them unless we activate the `force` parameter.

This implementation is not the same as that in `L2Bridge`, where we are setting the collection addresses, without checking it or supporting forcing functionality.

[bridge.cairo#L360-L364](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L360-L364)
```cairo
        fn set_l1_l2_collection_mapping(ref self: ContractState, collection_l1: EthAddress, collection_l2: ContractAddress) {
            ensure_is_admin(@self);
            self.l1_to_l2_addresses.write(collection_l1, collection_l2);
            self.l2_to_l1_addresses.write(collection_l2, collection_l1);
        }
```

As we can see forcing feature is not supported we are just modifying the collections without providing the checks we did in `L1Bridge`.

So the two bridges do not have the same implementation when setting `l1<->l2` addresses manually.

## Recommendations
Implement the forcing check that is in `L1Bridge` in `L2Bridge`.
