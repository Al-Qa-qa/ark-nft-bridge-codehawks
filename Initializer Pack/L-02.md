## Title
Single-step ownership transfer mechanism by `Ownable`

## Vulnerability Details
For contracts that `Bridge` inherits from them, they implement  single-step ownership transfer, this is not ideal for protocols where it can leave the contract without an owner if it transfers the ownership to a wrong address.

[UUPSProxied.sol#L14](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/UUPSProxied.sol#L14)
```solidity
contract UUPSOwnableProxied is Ownable, UUPSUpgradeable {
```

[State.sol#L13](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/State.sol#L13)
```solidity
contract StarklaneState is Ownable {
```

Single-step ownership transfer is dangerous as if the transfer is made to an incorrect address. the contract will be with no owner, and the role will be lost forever.

This will make the contract non-upgradable, where the owner is the only one who can upgrade the implementation of the Bridge.

NOTE: there are more than one Ownable contract but this will not make more than one owner for the contract, thanks to C3 linearization algorism, there will be only one owner for the `Bridge` contract.

## Recommendations

Use `Ownable2Step` instead of `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin.
