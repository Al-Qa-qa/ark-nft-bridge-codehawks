## Title
There is no way to change Bridgable ERC721 collections bytecode in `L1Bridge`.

## Vulnerability Details
When Deploying a new `ERC721` collection on `L1`, we are creating a new instance of `ERC721Bridgeable()`, and deploy it as a Proxy to be able to upgrade it.

[Deployer.sol#L30](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/token/Deployer.sol#L30)
```solidity
    function deployERC721Bridgeable( ... ) ... {
❌️      address impl = address(new ERC721Bridgeable());
        ...

        return address(new ERC1967Proxy(impl, dataInit));
    }
```

Since this interface `ERC721Bridgeable` is a constant bytecode when compiling the contract, it will make the code logic of `ERC721` that will get deployed when withdrawing from `L1` immutable and we can't change its logic.

If we checked `L2Bridge` we will find this is not how it works, where it supports changing the logic of the `ERC721` collection that will get deployed on `L2`. There is a function called `set_erc721_class_hash()` which changes the `class_hash` of the `ERC721` collection addresses (which is like changing the bytecode in EVM/solidity).

[bridge.cairo#L220-L223](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L220-L223)
```cairo
        fn set_erc721_class_hash(ref self: ContractState, class_hash: ClassHash) {
            ensure_is_admin(@self);
            self.erc721_bridgeable_class.write(class_hash);
        }
```

And by changing `erc721_bridgeable_class` the newly created NFTs collections on `L2` will have the Logic that represents that `class_hash`.

[bridge.cairo#L448-L455](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L448-L455)
```cairo
        let l2_addr_from_deploy = deploy_erc721_bridgeable(
❌️          self.erc721_bridgeable_class.read(),
            salt,
            req.name.clone(),
            req.symbol.clone(),
            req.base_uri.clone(),
            starknet::get_contract_address(),
        );
```

So in `L2Bridge` we will be able to change the Code Logic of the `ERC721` collection that will get deployed, but in `L1Bridge` we will not be able to do this. which means that the two Bridges are not consistent.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommendations
1. Make the `bytecode` a variable that can be changed, and since there is no constructor argument this will be enough.
2. Make the creation using `create` opcode, with providing that `bytecode` variable.
