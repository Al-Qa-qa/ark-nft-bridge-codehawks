## Title
The upgrading process will revert when initializing with new Owner

## Vulnerability Details

When upgrading `UUPS` upgradable contracts, the Proxy contract owner calls `upgradeToAndCall()` to change its implementation. And fire the initializing function of the new implementation in his context via delegate call.

When doing this thing in `Bridge`, we can see that it takes these variables as the initializing inputs.

```solidity
    function initialize(bytes calldata data) public onlyInit {
        (
❌️          address owner,
            IStarknetMessaging starknetCoreAddress,
            uint256 starklaneL2Address,
            uint256 starklaneL2Selector
        ) = abi.decode(
            data,
            (address, IStarknetMessaging, uint256, uint256)
        );
        _enabled = false;
        _starknetCoreAddress = starknetCoreAddress;

❌️      _transferOwnership(owner);

        setStarklaneL2Address(starklaneL2Address);
        setStarklaneL2Selector(starklaneL2Selector);
    }
```

As we can see we are taking the owner address as an input when upgrading our Bridge contract to the new implementation, gives him the ownership of the contract, and then sets `StarklaneL2Address` and `Selector`, and this is the problem.

The problem here is that when calling `setStarklaneL2Address` there is a modifier `onlyOwner`.

[State.sol#L42-L49](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/State.sol#L42-L49)
```solidity
    function setStarklaneL2Address(
        uint256 l2Address
    )
        public
❌️      onlyOwner
    {
        _starklaneL2Address = Cairo.snaddressWrap(l2Address);
    }
```

Since we are using `UUPS/ERC1967` upgradable proxy standard, we are calling `_authorizeUpgrade()`, to authorize the upgrading and we only let the owner to be able to upgrade in our contract (`Bridge`). So the `msg.sender` will be the owner of the contract.

[UUPSProxied.sol#L31-L37](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/UUPSProxied.sol#L31-L37)
```solidity
    function _authorizeUpgrade(
        address
    )
        internal
        override
❌️      onlyOwner
    { }
```

Since it is allowed to change the owner when upgrading the contract as we illustrated, the upgrading process will end up reverting because of `onlyOwner` check when calling `setStarklaneL2Address()` as the owner is not the `msg.sender` now.

This will end up failing the upgrading process at the last check, which is not actual behavior. Leading to the failure of the upgradability process and the loss money paid as the Gas Cost for deploying.

## Impact
- Failing of the upgradability process.
- Lossing the gas cost paid for the upgrading process.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
Change the ownership in the last of the `Bridge::initialize()` function.
