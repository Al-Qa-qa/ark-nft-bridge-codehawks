## Title
Implementation contract left uninitialized and can be initialized

## Vulnerability Details
The `Bridge` contract will be `ERC1967`, and the implementation will be the `Bridge`. But If we checked the Bridge implementation we will find that it is left initialized, and anyone can initialize it.

This will allow anyone to initialize the implementation contract and take its OwnerShip.

## Recommendations
Prevent initializing the contract the implementation contract. This can be done by initializing `address(0)`, this will prevent initializing the implementation contract in the init logic implemented by the team.
