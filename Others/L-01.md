## Title
Unchecking address hash Collision when deploying NFT collection on L2

## Vulnerability Details

When We Bridge NFTs from Ethereum to Starknet, we are deploying a new NFT collection if needed.

When making the deploying process, we are using `Salt` (similar to Create2 in solidity). But the problem is that we are not checking if there is hash collision or not.

[collection_manager.cairo#L153-L157](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/token/collection_manager.cairo#L153-L157)
```cairo
fn deploy_erc721_bridgeable( ... ) -> ContractAddress {
    ...

    match starknet::deploy_syscall(class_hash, salt, calldata.span(), false) {
❌️      Result::Ok((addr, _)) => addr,
        // TODO: do we want an event emitted here?
        Result::Err(revert_reason) => panic(revert_reason)
    }
}
```

As we can see we are returning the address after deploying, but if there is a Hash Collision the function will not revert it will just return `address(0)` as in Solidity/EVM.

## Impact
Completing the process of Bridging tokens even if deploying NFT collection on Layer 2 fails.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommendations
Check for the returned address, and revert if it was an `address(0)`.

     }
```

_NOTE: reverting is not the best choice here, as this will result in Losing Bridged NFTs, but also hash collision will result in failure of the deployment process, which will make the address not the NFT collection we need, and will result in incorrect L1<->L2 collection mappings. So implementing this check with a method to recover NFTs on L2 is a good choice._
