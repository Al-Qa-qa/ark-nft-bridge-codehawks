## Title
Deposites from L2 to L1 will be unwithdrawable from L1 when activating `use_withdraw_auto`

## Vulnerability Details
There was an issue related to Auto Withdrawals from L1 reported by `Cairo_Security_Clan`, and the team chose to remove this feature from the L1 side when withdrawing.

[Bridge.sol#L169-L173](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/Bridge.sol#L169-L173)
```solidity
        if (Protocol.canUseWithdrawAuto(header)) {
            // 2024-03-19: disabled autoWithdraw after audit report
            // _consumeMessageAutoWithdraw(_starklaneL2Address, request);
❌️          revert NotSupportedYetError();
        } else { ... }
```

The problem is that this value is still taken as a parameter from the user in L2 Bridge when depositing Tokens. And no check guarantees that the value will be `false`, it is left to the user to set it.

[bridge.cairo#L249](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/starknet/src/bridge.cairo#L249)
```cairo
        fn deposit_tokens(
            ref self: ContractState,
            salt: felt252,
            collection_l2: ContractAddress,
            owner_l1: EthAddress,
            token_ids: Span<u256>,
❌️          use_withdraw_auto: bool,
            use_deposit_burn_auto: bool,
        ) { ... }
```

So people Bridging From L2 still think that auto withdrawal is supported. But it is actually not. which will end up Locking for their NFT in the L2 Bridge and the inability to withdraw them from L1 as it will always revert.

## Proof of Concept
- UserA Wanted to Bridge one NFT from L2 to L1.
- UserA thinks `use_withdraw_auto` is allowed as it is to him to either set or not set it.
- UserA called `L2Bridge::deposit_tokens()` by setting `use_withdraw_auto` to true.
- UserA Waited till `Starknet` verified the tx and put his message as an approved `L2toL1` message.
- UserA tried to withdraw his NFTs on L1 by calling `L1Bridge::withdrawTokens()`.
- Transactions get reverted whenever he tries to withdraw his token on L1.

## Impact
Permanent Lock of NFTs on L2 Bridge Side and the inability to withdraw them from L1 side.

## Tools Used
Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation
Ensure that `use_withdraw_auto` is set to false when withdrawing from L2 side.
