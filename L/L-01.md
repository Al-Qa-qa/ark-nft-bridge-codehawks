## Title
Using `Ownable` instead of `OwnableUpgradable` for Upgradable contracts

## Vulnerability Details
When dealing with upgradable contracts, it is better to make the Access Control and Privilege Roles in a separate storage location ruther than with normal variables (making it in a slot far away from slots 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), this is to prevent any problem when upgrading the contract like storage collision that may lead to renouncing the ownership and losing the access control for the contract.

The current contracts which `Bridge` contract inherits from them implement OpenZeppelin `Ownable` not `OwnableUpgradable`.

[UUPSProxied.sol#L14](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/UUPSProxied.sol#L14)
```solidity
contract UUPSOwnableProxied is Ownable, UUPSUpgradeable {
```

[State.sol#L13](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-ark-project/blob/main/apps/blockchain/ethereum/src/State.sol#L13)
```solidity
contract StarklaneState is Ownable {
```

## Recommendations
Use OpenZeppelin [`OwnableUpgradable`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol) instead of `Ownable`.
